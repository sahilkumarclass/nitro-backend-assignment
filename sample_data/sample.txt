This is a sample text file for testing the File Parser API.

The API supports multiple file formats including:
- CSV files
- Excel files (xlsx, xls)
- PDF files
- Text files

Features:
1. File upload with progress tracking
2. Automatic file parsing
3. Background processing
4. RESTful API endpoints
5. Real-time status updates

This file contains multiple lines to test the text parsing functionality.
Each line will be counted and analyzed by the parser.

The API uses Django REST Framework for the backend and Celery for background tasks.
PostgreSQL is used for metadata storage and MongoDB for parsed content.

End of sample text file.
